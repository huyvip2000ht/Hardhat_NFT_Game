# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```
npx i --save-dev hardhat
npx i ......

npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat run  .\scripts\sample-script.js
npx hardhat node  
npx hardhat verify --network mainnet DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS
```



```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
